# Richness-Productivity
Relationships between plant species richness and primary productivity between native- and exotic-dominated grasslands

Code included R code for for figures and ANCOVA analyses in Wilsey et al. (2023) Ecology Letters, Figures 1, 2, and 3.  Code is included for Analysis of Covariance of primary productivity measures (Y) and a covariate (plant species richness and a categorical treatment variable (native species dominance or non-native (Exotic) species dominance.  Interactions between the covariate and the treatment tests whether slopes or productivity and richness differ between treatments.  Three study data sets (stored in Dryad) were used in the analysis, MEND (Maintenance of Exotic vs. Native Diversity) study in central Texas, BioGen study in western Iowa, and a latitudinal gradient of paired native dominated and exotic dominated sites from Minnesota to central Texas.
